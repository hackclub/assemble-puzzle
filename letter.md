Dear Hack Clubber,

You found us, haven‚Äôt you? Congrats for uncovering our secret summer project. You probably had to poke around to get here. Maybe you saw the clues immediately. Maybe it took some time. Perhaps you even had help from someone.

Now that you‚Äôve made it please don‚Äôt spoil the fun! You can share that you got our message and our postcard above, but the content of this letter is just between us. If you still want to be involved, you should offer a hand in the Slack and share your wisdom with someone looking for help to also reach this page.

With that out of the way, we‚Äôre super excited to share some news with you: we're organizing Assemble, **an IRL hackathon in San Francisco from 5th-7th of August**. Around 150 attendees will join us‚Äì fellow Hack Clubbers, new high schoolers outside the community, and [some previous AMA guests](https://hackclub.com/amas#past-amas).

We're still locking in the final logistics before we share this publicly, so stay tuned for the official post going out in the [#announcements](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C0266FRGT) channel late next week. For the time being, don't book your flights. Don't think about travel. Just know this is coming.

Thank you so much for finding us. We‚Äôll be in touch,

\- The Assemble Team
