          Dear Hack Clubber,
        </p>
        <p>
          You found us, haven‚Äôt you? You probably had to poke around to get
          here. Maybe you saw the bug immediately. Maybe it took some time.
          Perhaps you even had help from someone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you‚Äôve made it, please don‚Äôt spoil the fun! You can share
          that you got in, and our postcard, but this letter is just between us.
          If you still want to be involved, you should offer a hand in the slack
          and share your wisdom to anyone looking for help to also reach this
          page.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that out of the way, we‚Äôre super excited to share some news with
          you: we're organizing Assemble, an IRL hackathon in SF from 5th-7th of
          August. Around 150 attendees will join us‚Äì fellow Hack Clubbers, new
          high schoolers outside the community, and <a
          href="https://hackclub.com/amas#past-amas">some previous AMA
          guests</a>. This is an event put on by Hack Clubbers, a gift from us,
          to you. We appreciate the funding Hack Club HQ is giving, and we‚Äôre
          going to show them how far we can go with it.
        </p>
        <p>We're still locking in the final logistics before we share this
        publicly, so stay tuned for the official post going out in the
        #announcements channel late next week.</p>
        <p>
          Thank you so much for finding us. We‚Äôll be in touch,
        </p>
        <p>
